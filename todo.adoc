= ToDo

* Memory Repository and MongoDB Repository should return the same when not found items, now one return undefined other one null.

== Backlog

* Remove sensitive class and use Resolved class only
* IAmId should start the server
* Unauthorized test: see coverage
* Create our own ESLint config (extending standard???)
* When is possible to have auto consent, we need to provide the accountID to Consent Object in another step.

== Clean Up

* Review Jenkins files
