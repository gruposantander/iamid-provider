= ToDo

* Put consent repo name at Consent level so is the same in all places please.
* Id is duplicated in data base
* Reproduce error of several documents with same client and user in consent database
* Memory Repository and MongoDB Repository should return the same when not found items, now one return undefined other one null.

== Backlog

* Remove sensitive class and use Resolved class only
