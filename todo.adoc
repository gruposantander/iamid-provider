= ToDo

* IAmId should start the server

== IAL

* Test: filter a response with lower ial
* Remove sensitive class and use Resolved class only
* Remove filter values from assertion lang

== Backlog

* Launch all events from a single point, All events should be emitted by app
* Unauthorized test: see coverage
* Test compile method in assertion lang specs
* Create our own ESLint config (extending standard???)

== Clean Up

* System text are obsolete: remove or update
* Review Jenkins files

== Docs

* In connectors change the way we call connectors because should be done using a resolve() method and a proxy? we should review this because is not very easy to explain or use...
* Should we describe events emitted or we wait for the implementation of functional events and this things??
* In IamIdRouter in library api we should also add the HTTPError description
* Look for IamId and replace with iamid-provider
* In endpoint doc in == Login endpoint probably the contract change a lot after acr and more features.
* In connnectors describe more about resolved or not resolved and the arrays.
* When public describe repositoryes here.
