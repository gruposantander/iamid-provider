= ToDo

* Put consent repo name at Consent level so is the same in all places please.
* Id is duplicated in data base
* Reproduce error of several documents with same client and user in consent database
* Memory Repository and MongoDB Repository should return the same when not found items, now one return undefined other one null.

== Backlog

* Remove sensitive class and use Resolved class only
* IAmId should start the server
* Unauthorized test: see coverage
* Create our own ESLint config (extending standard???)
* When is possible to have auto consent, we need to provide the accountID to Consent Object in another step.

== Clean Up

* Review Jenkins files

== Opensource
* Refactor router and put the logic in the models or in other files.
* We are forcing the consent what should we do with that? Thinks that we need to implement things in order to support all the scenarios.
* We are changing the ctx in two namespaces put all inside iamid, the interaction data also... and document.
