= ToDo

* Launch all events from a single point, All events should be emitted by app
* Split tests for lib and impl:
** events
**  router
* Split demo app configuration from test configuration for IAmId
* IT test add whitelist
* Move minibank client defaults to configuration
* Unauthorized test: see coverage

== Backlog

* Test compile method in assertion lang specs
* Create our own ESLint config (extending standard???)

== Clean Up

* Reduce root files
* Review Tests
** Extract common methods (userinfo)
* Tests in folders by functionality
* System text are obsolete: remove or update
* Review Jenkins files

== Docs
* We need to review the npm install command when we deploy this concretely to nexus.
* When split the project put link sin readme.adoc to the "reference project"
* review the name of the library in the code snipts exposed in "library.adoc"
* Should we describe events emitted or we wait for the implementation of functional events and this things??
* In IamIdRouter in library api we should also add the HTTPError description

== About split
* Review libraries that are used
* review version..
* review code coverage.
* Analize test that dont belong to the library?
* test event emmiter or just wait for the functional events?
* Should we remove the appender? as is not used??
